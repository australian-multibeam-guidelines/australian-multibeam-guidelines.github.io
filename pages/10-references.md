3 An interferometric multibeam measures the angle of the incoming sound wave fronts in a time sequence of samples. Slant range is obtained from the time of the sample and speed of sound.

 

4 A beamforming multibeam mathematically forms a set of "beams" and detects the range to the seabed in each beam.

 

5 The sidelobes are smaller beams that are away from the main beam. These sidelobes represent energy received in undesired directions which can never be completely eliminated.

 

6 In the field of digital signal processing, the sampling theorem is a fundamental bridge between continuous-time signals (often called "analog signals") and discrete-time signals (often called "digital signals"). It establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite bandwidth.




<h1>Platform Description</h1>
<p>Swath mapping systems use acoustic technology to collect information on the bathymetry (topography) and the backscatter (impedance) of the seafloor (Figure 3.1). These systems can either be mounted on a ship, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). They work by transmitting a sound pulse, called a ping, through a transmitter at a specific frequency (or are able to sweep through a range of frequencies). This same ping is then recorded through a receiver placed very close to the transmitter. The elapsed time that the ping takes to reach the seafloor and return to the receiver is used to measure the depth of the water. Certain attributes of the shape of the sound-wave are used to infer characteristics about the seafloor (geomorphology, substrate type) (Figure 3.1 a-d).  </p>

<p>Swath mapping systems, including multibeam and interferometric echosounders, have become one of the standard tools for geophysical surveying and mapping of the seafloor and have been used for a variety of scientific, safety at sea (hydrographic and military operations) and industrial applications. These systems can produce a spatially continuous acoustic image of the surface of the seafloor by generating a “swath” or “fan” of closed spaced data points, increasing the resolution of the resulting surfaces. This has revolutionized our ability to understand physical processes occurring at the seafloor, and the composition and distribution of substrate, which has in turn significantly improved our knowledge of seafloor ecosystems (McArthur et al. 2010, Lucieer and Lamarche 2011, Porter-Smith et al. 2012). Mapping of bathymetric morphology will delineate geological features that have relief (using the changes in seafloor depth information), however in regions where the relief is smaller than the minimum mapping unit (resolution of the grid cell is larger than the feature of interest) backscatter data can be used to assess the boundaries of the geology or sediment structure.</p>

<p>Australia’s marine jurisdiction spans an incredible range of water depths; from the coast to over 6000 m. Water depth has a very large influence on the acoustic survey acquisition as it will dictate the resolution of the data (i.e., number of pings per unit area which will dictate the minimum pixel size) and the efficiency for surveying using swath mapping systems (i.e., swath width). While practices for employing the equipment have developed rapidly over the last few decades, there are a number of specific and common issues that need to be considered and detailed in a national standard operating field manual.

# Multibeam Acoustics for Marine Monitoring

The use of MBES for mapping and monitoring marine habitats has experienced a rapid increase since 2000 (Figure 3.3), and there is now a wealth of knowledge from which we can synthesise a 'best practices' document.

Figure 3.3. Annual total of peer reviewed papers featuring multibeam mapping for seafloor survey (Web of Science 2017- search words "multibeam seafloor habitat survey"). 

The **objectives** of MBES surveys conducted by mapping programs are to collect seafloor data to identify, delineate and map biogenic, anthropogenic and geological features. This objective requires particular data to be collected that can a) chart the water depths creating a high resolution bathymetric map at an appropriate resolution in regards to the target habitat or feature and b) be able to differentiate boundaries between different substrate and/or habitat types.

To meet these objectives, there are two particular needs for mapping and surveying that can be defined as either baseline surveys or monitoring surveys (see Table 2). MBES can be used for both survey types, however, they have different acquisition and post-processing standards.  A **baseline survey** is for exploratory purposes where data will be collected in a 'single pass operation'. These data are used to map the distribution of marine benthic habitats at a particular spatial scale, and provide information necessary for more targeted field surveys using such tools as towed video, AUVs and stereo baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVs) (Lucieer et al. 2013, Monk et al. 2016). In contrast, a **monitoring survey** may have already identified target habitats or features  (such as rocky outcrops) from previous broad scale  or other hydrographic data that are to be monitored to assess change in distribution and extent (Rattray et al. 2009, McGonigle et al. 2010). This type of survey will require MBES data to be collected at a higher resolution and with a greater degree of positional accuracy.  Mapping for baseline survey and monitoring surveys will be dealt with separately throughout the manual, with their differences and the requirements that need to be considered to meet the aims of each survey type outlined in Figure 3.4.

## Pre-Survey Preparations

There are several important factors that first need to be considered in order to ensure relevant areas are surveyed, time and costs can be accurately estimated, appropriate vessels and acquisition gear is used, and previous survey data are considered. 

Firstly, it is important that all spatial data for the survey region must be sourced to gain a preliminary understanding of the seabed as this will influence several survey considerations. This information can be used to create a _survey plan_, which would include a summary of the following components: 



*   The coverage of the area to be surveyed (bounding box) with the datum and coordinate system clearly identified,
*   Planned survey lines (direction and acquisition order of the survey lines),
*   System calibration survey lines (patch test),
*   Seafloor topography (features of interest) and slope, and
*   The location and frequency of the Sound Velocity Profile (SVP).

Background spatial data might include electronic nautical charts from the Australian Hydrographic Office (AHO), aerial photos (in shallow water regions), satellite imagery, LiDAR or satellite derived bathymetry data.  It may also include previous maps of seabed habitats generated from single beam acoustic surveys or maps of sediment distribution from broad scale seafloor grab or dredge surveys.  Information on seabed habitats can also be collected by analysing the distribution of other activities conducted within the survey region (for example, ancillary research such as fisheries surveys may be an indicator of habitat type). Refer to [AusSeabed](http://marine.ga.gov.au/#/mbes_coverage) coverage map and data hub to identify existing MBES surveys noting that the website and repository are under development.

The survey plan aims to establish the range of water depths and seafloor complexity across the survey region. The range of water depths will define how many survey lines need to be conducted to ensure sufficient overlap between the acoustic swaths to guarantee 100 % seafloor coverage (refer to Chapter 2 where coverage may relate to selected sampling sites). Where the water depth is relatively constant (such as on the outer continental shelf), the survey plan may provide adequate structure for accurate planning. In shallower waters, where the depths may change rapidly (or are unknown to the resolution of national satellite derived products) a comprehensive plan of survey lines may not be useful, as they will need to be modified as the bathymetric data are collected. In this case, a defined survey area boundary (polygon) with an initial survey line for calibration may be sufficient. 

An essential component of the survey-planning phase is the need to obtain the relevant permits that may apply for sediment data collection which is common for MBES data validation, especially when conducted within marine parks. See Appendix B for a list of potential permits needed.

Following the establishment of the survey plan the logistical preparations for data acquisition can be conducted. These are outlined in the following sections and recorded in the vessel or field logbook over the duration of the survey and made available in the final reporting documentation. 

Refer to Section 2 of the Australian National Guidelines to access further planning details (Picard et al., 2018). This include submitting basic metadata information to an [upcoming survey register](http://marine.ga.gov.au/#/upcoming_surveys) to inform the seabed mapping community of the mapping intentions and promote further collaboration and optimise the survey.


## Data Acquisition


### Installation offsets

Mobilisation, calibration and validation of the MBES, aims to establish the spatial relationship between all of the system's components (e.g., GPS, transducer, motion reference unit ) with the vessel's frame of reference, and is paramount to obtaining high resolution and accurate data. Section 3 of the Australian Multibeam Guidelines provide an overview and details of these steps (Picard et al. 2018).

The vessel's Central Reference Point (CRP) is determined upon each _new _installation of a MBES system and to best suit the vessels balance, and installation criteria (if the MBES is hull or pole mounted) ([Edward and Martin 2015](file:///C:\Users\u99337\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary%20Internet%20Files\Content.Outlook\13SAM0XD\NESP%20Field%20Manual_v0.2_MBES%20(2).docx#_3o7alnk)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">; Figure 7 of Picard et al., 2018</span>).  The CRP is defined and recorded along with the installation offsets of the system's components within the various logging software Where possible the CRP should be defined at the MBES transducer directly. All installation offsets are required to be recorded and detailed within the survey report and processing log of the supplied raw data files (see proposed reporting templates in Picard et al. 2018)

Although this manual recommends that depths be provided in relation to the ellipsoid, to enable other users to reduce data to chart datum, vessel draft should be measured at the start and end of surveys and dynamic draft taken into consideration with measurements of the waterline conducted regularly. This will ensure that the depth charted is the true depth and not depth under keel and will account for changes due to for example, fuel usage where applicable. The vessel draft is recorded during a survey in the vessel log and/or entered in the acquisition system. 


### Data logging

During a survey with a MBES system there are a number of data products that should be recorded and settings that should be taken into consideration. These mainly include the following, but section 4 of the Australian Multibeam Guidelines provides further details.: 



1. MBES Raw data: log raw proprietary format (e.g. *.all for Kongsberg, *.s7k for Reson) or ancillary systems. Files should be recorded for a duration of 30 minutes for shallow systems (< 150 m) and 120 minutes for deep systems (> 150 m) to account for computer processing speed. Raw positional data and motion datagrams are to be recorded within the raw sonar file and at a rate of 1Hz and 100Hz respectively. 
2. Seabed backscatter sonar data: Log complete backscatter i.e. beam intensity (RIθ and snippets or equivalent). 
3. Water column data [Recommended, if available]: log to a separate file in proprietary format (e.g. *.wcd for Kongsberg). These files can take up a large amount of storage space (~ 10 times raw bathymetry), and the surveyor must ensure necessary disc space prior to collection.
4. Delayed heave: delayed heave datagrams are recorded by the acquisition computer and logged to files in the proprietary format. 
5. File naming convention: It is important that the surveyor adhere to a consistent and acceptable naming convention that links to the metadata of the raw data format. The convention should be sequential, include timestamp and system type, e.g. nnnn_yyyymmdd_hhmmss_system, where: nnnn is the sequential number; yyyymmdd is the date; hhmmss is the time  
6. Filters and settings: Both noise and spike filters should be monitored during the survey to ensure the data quality and integrity is maintained over the course of the survey. Beam spacing mode should be set to equidistant. It is very important that the pulse length should not be changed at any time during the survey so that all data are standardised.
7. GNSS track: Should be provided as track plots (in x, y format) to enable interpretation of the vessel transits. 


### Sound velocity profiles

A SVP measures the speed of sound in water at different vertical levels in the water column. This information is used for ray tracing (path length and refraction) and to accurately form the beam of the sound in the case of MBES with flat array transducers. It is thus important that a SVP sensor be deployed to collect this information.  The SVP can be determined using one of the following four methods:



*   Direct observation via deployment of a SVP measuring device (e.g. Valeport monitor)
*   Calculation of SVP through deployment of an eXpendable Bathy Thermograph (XBT)
*   Calculation of SVP using CTD (Conductivity/Temperature/Depth) data and applying the UNESCO formula ([https://www.usna.edu/Users/physics/ejtuchol/documents/SP411/Chapter4.pdf](https://www.usna.edu/Users/physics/ejtuchol/documents/SP411/Chapter4.pdf)) or;
*   Calculation of SVP from Sea Surface Temperature and Climatology using SVP builder software (Sinquin et al. 2016). 

 Depending on the location of the survey and the oceanographic conditions over the area (sea state, mixing regime, thermal layering etc.) of the survey, SVP should be conducted at the appropriate intervals or location. SVP must be taken _within_ the survey area at least once per day, but up to multiple times a day where necessary. For example, profiles will vary in proximity to an estuary due to freshwater inflows from rivers or currents from areas with different salinity. 

_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why are SVP so important? </span>_

A MBES system emits a sound pulse in an arc out from the transducer. As the sounds contacts the seabed, it is reflected/backscattered back towards the transducer and received. Each backscattered pulse from each individual seabed point can be considered a discrete beam. The speed of the beam through the water column is governed by the water temperature and density. Because the water column, in most cases, is not evenly mixed, the speed of the pulse changes at different levels in the water column. At each change in speed, refraction or 'bending of the pulse path' occurs, unless the angle of incidence is equal to 90 degrees, as with a single beam echosounder. Refraction can happen many times throughout the pulse's path through the water column. Therefore, to enable best ray tracing possible and consequently depth conversion of each sounding, details of the water column sound profile are essential. 


### Geodetic parameters

The datum parameters entered into the acquisition software will use the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) datum. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The use of differential GPS as a positioning system is required</span> for all on-shelf and off-shelf multibeam acoustic data collection as we aim to resolve an absolute positional accuracy greater than 1 m. Any datum shifts will need to be applied at the post-processing stage. Section 2.5 of the Australian Multibeam Guidelines provides additional details regarding datum.


### Survey speed 

The speed of the vessel will have a direct impact on the density of soundings reaching the seafloor, the quality of the data (in the return signal) and to some degree determine the resolution of the final raster datasets (as it dictates the distance along track between pings). The distance between pings along the track of the vessel is determined by the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and ship speed; the faster the vessel, the fewer pulses ensonify the seafloor per distance along track. The swath width also limits the pulse rate- where a wide swath results in a lower ping rate or a greater space between pings. Aeration problems (bubble sweep) are a function of sea state but also of the heading with respect to the wave direction and the vessel speed. Aeration problems reduce the signal or the quality of the signal at the transducer head. Higher speeds also increase vibrations in the transducer head (depending on the installation- for example pole mounts). 

It is strongly advised that the surveyor creates a record of aeration problems versus sea state with respect to heading and vessel speed. This record will be helpful in ensuring that the survey is performed efficiently with a minimum of line rejections and corresponding reruns and infills. This should be recorded in the field log book.


### Line spacing

Line spacing is the distance between adjacent survey lines. The best spacing between survey lines is determined by a combination of horizontal range limit (sonar coverage from one transducer) expected at that depth of water and the accuracy required from the survey (either baseline mapping or monitoring). The horizontal range expected depends on the water depth as well as the sea state, seabed type and the sonar frequency. If the surveyor is using two transducer heads, the total swath width from the port edge to the starboard edge increases the range by allowing you to 'see' a wider swath in terms of angle.  

The horizontal range is limited by two factors: grazing angle and spreading loss. The grazing angle limit is related to the angle that the sound "beam" makes with the seabed. At the grazing angle limit, the sound makes a very small angle with the seabed. Most of the sound at this point is reflected away and the signal scattered back from the seabed is too small to be detected. 

Due to this loss of signal on the outer beams of the swath, some overlap in swath is required. A minimum of 30% overlap should take into account line keeping errors and where sea state is calm and create a 100% coverage of the seafloor. The type of survey being undertaken will determine the overlap with the highest quality requiring 60% overlap (monitoring) and the lowest quality requiring 30% overlap (baseline; Table 3.2).

The seafloor topography and the slope (gradient of the slope) is an important consideration for planning the survey lines. For MBES data collection, it is strongly advised to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">run the lines parallel to the seabed contours (along the slope, not up or down the slope)</span>. This is beneficial for keeping the coverage reasonably constant along the survey lines (as the swath width will vary with depth). It is also beneficial because less acoustic energy is reflected towards the transducer from steep slopes, causing poorer detections and the possibility of false detections in the sidelobes<sup>5</sup>. If survey lines must run up and down the slope, a reduction of vessel speed or reduction in swath width may be required to allow for the echo sounder to track the bottom continuously. Planned lines must be activated in this instance to ensure that gaps are not created between the survey lines as the swath coverage is reduced coming into shallow water and additional lines may need to be added.

For surveys where backscatter information is critical, the overlapping area should be increased (from 60% to 100%) to compensate for the high variability of individual backscatter intensities on the edges of the outer beam (Gavrilov & Parnum, 2010). For surveys where backscatter information is considered a secondary product, it is recommended that the overlapping be kept as minimal as practical (30% overlap).

Crosslines are survey lines that are run across the main set of survey lines. They are critical to ensuring the quality assessment of the data, especially the management of data uncertainties. It is thus highly recommended to plan multiple crosslines


### Pulse length 

The pulse length affects the amount of the transmitted acoustic energy into the water and the vertical resolution of the observed depth.  Increasing pulse length enhances penetration through the water column but reduces vertical resolution. 

Pulse length and sampling frequency must be considered as related to backscatter data. The sampling frequency of the system must be considered in order to hold the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem<sup>6</sup>. This enables the analogue signal to be reconstructed from the digital data (e.g. Kongsberg EM3002 systems recommended minimum pulse length of 100µsec or greater). 


### Tides and GPS tides

All soundings shall be reduced to an ellipsoid with a minimum depth accuracy of 0.2% relative to water depth.  However, tidal information is useful for other applications and users, such as the production of chart. It is thus important to record at a minimum the GPS tides from the GNSS system. Refer to section 2.5 of the Australian Multibeam Guidelines for further details (Picard et al., 2018).  


## Data Processing

There are a number of software packages available for processing MBES data and many of the software are in commercial proprietary to the specific MBES system used for acquisition. Regardless of the data processing software that is used, the goal is for the minimum final products to be released at the completion of a field survey (summarised in Table 3.3).

The data acquisition parameters are established to ensure that the data are fit for the purposes of benthic habitat mapping (i.e. baseline) and monitoring of Australia's waters. The post-processing parameters and techniques, on the other hand, are generally optimised for a targeted purpose (and differ for a baseline or monitoring survey (i.e. data fit for purpose)). Section 5 of the Australian Multibeam Guidelines provides generic information related to processing during and after a sea floor mapping survey (Picard et al., 2018).

During the survey, bathymetry and backscatter datasets shall be processed and plotted onboard to monitor the data coverage and quality. This will allow for additional survey lines to be collected prior to the finalisation of the survey, in the event of data gaps between survey lines for example.


### Bathymetric data processing

Uncertainty related to the bathymetric measurements can be quantified and incorporated into a statistical model to derive the total propagated uncertainty (TPU) of the resulting bathymetric surfaces. A number of factors (see appendix E in Picard et al., 2018) will influence this uncertainty including: draft setting of the transducer, incorrect sound velocity profiles, spatial variation in the sound velocity, temporal variation in the sound velocity, instrumental uncertainty (internal precision of the MBES unit) and motion (incorrect heave, pitch and roll corrections), settlement and squat of the vessel in the water and incorrect tidal corrections to name a few.

Where possible the TPU should be computed using the CUBE (Combined Uncertainty and Bathymetry Estimator).  CUBE uses soundings and their associated uncertainty estimates as input and through spatial and uncertainty weighting, while also relying on the very high data density of multibeam data sets, outputs a bathymetry gridded surface and its associated uncertainty (error) surface. In addition, it tracks the statistical hypotheses for each depth point, and where there is more than one estimate, makes an attempt to determine which the most likely value is. This makes it a very powerful tool for identifying and removing outliers in the data. Once these have been removed from the data, CUBE is rerun to generate the final bathymetry and uncertainty surfaces. See "CUBE Bathymetric data Processing and Analysis (CHS February 2012)". The uncertainty surface is a quantification of the survey quality, which can be compared against specifications and used as input to the metadata for the survey (CHS 2013).


### Backscatter data processing

For optimal processing procedures for MBES backscatter image generation, refer to Lurton and Lamarche, 2015. A final compensated geotiff mosaic of the acoustic backscatter for the survey region should be generated.


## Data Interpretation

MBES bathymetric data will be processed to characterise and classify the seafloor in terms relevant to understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of benthic habitats. The combination of bathymetry and textural surfaces (backscatter) provide an excellent reference dataset for research and management of Australian marine seafloor habitats. 

Geomorphological analysis can be used to classify the multibeam bathymetry data and define the extents of particular habitat types such as seagrass beds, rocky reef, and sand plains. We recommend the use of the national standardised benthic habitat classification nomenclature as documented by Seamap Australia (Butler et al. 2017). Importantly, this classification system includes other established and developing national classification schema such as CATAMI (Althaus et al. 2015) and Geoscience Australia's _Classification and Glossary of Seabed Geomorphology_.

The backscatter Geotiff can be interpreted into a sediment distribution and habitat map using one of two automated segmentation methods:



1. Image-based segmentation (e.g., using e-Cognition ([www.ecognition.com](http://www.ecognition.com/))) where the image is segmented into regions of similar backscatter characteristics and using the bathymetric data to identify these boundaries and transition zone. These segments are then classified as surface features, backscatter intensity patterns of sediment/habitat distribution etc (Lucieer and Lamarche, 2011).
2. Signal based segmentation (e.g., using ENVI ([www.esriaustralia.com.au/envi](http://www.esriaustralia.com.au/envi)) where changes in the backscatter intensity, with increasing grazing angle from nadir, are analysed to classify the data (Hamilton and Parnum, 2011).
3. Pixel based methods (Collier and Brown, 2005).

## Data Release

At the time of writing this manual, there is not currently a complete repository for multibeam data collected in Australian waters, although several agencies house some multibeam data (e.g. AHO, GA, IMOS, CSIRO), and several portals promote its accessibility and visualisation (e.g. [seamapaustralia.org](http://seamapaustralia.org)). However, as part of the [AusSeabed](http://www.ausseabed.gov.au) program, the development of the AusSeabed data hub, managed by Geoscience Australia (GA), is underway and will be linked to appropriate visualisation platforms. It is estimated that the hub will be functional by 2020. 

In the meantime data can be stored and archived by GA, and made discoverable through the [AusSeabed data coverage](http://marine.ga.gov.au/#/mbes_coverage) and accessible via email request to [AusSeabed@ga.gov.au](mailto:AusSeabed@ga.gov.au). Following the steps listed below will ensure timely release of data and maximise data discoverability:



1. Create metadata record(s) describing the survey and data collection (for both raw and QA/QC data products). Minimum metadata requirements for multibeam data include the following:
*   Title of the survey region (e.g., AMP name and ID) and, if not a well-established region, its geographic boundary;
*   Surveyor's name and company;
*   Start and end dates of the survey;
*   Vessel name, type of vessel and MBES unit used, details regarding the positioning system, acquisition software, and operation parameters;
*   The number of lines recorded and corresponding number of kilometres; and
*   Summary of the main survey results (water depths, observed tidal range, sonar features of interest- anomalies, unusual targets etc.).
2. Publish metadata record(s) to the [Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN) catalogue](http://catalogue.aodn.org.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/main.home) as soon as possible after metadata has been QC-d. This can be done in one of two ways:
*   If metadata from your agency is regularly harvested by the AODN, follow agency-specific protocols for metadata and data release. 
*   Otherwise, metadata records can be created and submitted via the [AODN Data Submission Tool](https://metadataentry.aodn.org.au/submit)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> at [https://metadataentry.aodn.org.au/submit](https://metadataentry.aodn.org.au/submit)</span>. Note that user registration is required, but this is free and immediate.
3. Generate interactive OGC complient web services layers of the following derived data layers:
*   Location map with limits of the survey area;
*   Bathymetric map showing the depths, slope and bathymetric hill shading results;
*   Backscatter data map showing boundaries between habitat features;
*   Location of auxiliary data sampling (point features of sediment grabs) or transect lines of video surveys; and
*   Map showing the track plot of the vessel position, indicating the region of the patch test calibration.
4. Upload data files identified in Table 3.3 and all field records generated during the survey to a secure, publicly accessible online repository or on a portable hard drive and send to Geoscience Australia, attn AusSeabed. Please also inform [AusSeabed@ga.gov.au](mailto:AusSeabed@ga.gov.au) of the delivery.
5. If available, add links to the location of raw data and derived map imagery to the previously published metadata record. Metadata accompanied by map imagery as described above may be additionally showcased through the [Australian Ocean Data Network portal](https://portal.aodn.org.au/data).
6. Produce a technical or post-survey report documenting the purpose of the survey, sampling locations, sampling equipment specifications etc. Provide links to this report in all associated metadata records _[Recommended]_. 
7. Data to be made publicly available under a Creative Commons by attribution non-commercial licence.


## Field Manual Maintenance

<sup>3 </sup>An interferometric multibeam measures the angle of the incoming sound wave fronts in a time sequence of samples. Slant range is obtained from the time of the sample and speed of sound.

<sup>4</sup> A beamforming multibeam mathematically forms a set of "beams" and detects the range to the seabed in each beam.

<sup>5</sup> The sidelobes are smaller beams that are away from the main beam. These sidelobes represent energy received in undesired directions which can never be completely eliminated.

<sup>6</sup> In the field of digital signal processing, the sampling theorem is a fundamental bridge between continuous-time signals (often called "analog signals") and discrete-time signals (often called "digital signals"). It establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite bandwidth.
