Equipment must be appropriately set up to ensure as much consistency as possible among surveys and facilitate gear replacement if necessary. The key components for a benthic stereo-BRUV include the following:

 

* Per stereo-BRUV unit:

    * 2 x cameras (with batteries and memory cards). Cameras capable of operating in low-light conditions are recommended (e.g. Canon HF G40 ~$1500). Cheaper action cameras (e.g. GoPro) are typically not adequate for low-light conditions.

    * 2 x camera housings (with o-rings)

    * Frame with weights

    * Bait arm with bait bag/container (reinforced if needed)

    * Bait

    * Synchronizing device (i.e. clapper board or synchronizing diode)

    * Lighting (If required, for example if sampling in depths >60m. Light colour choice is important and blue light is recommended (Fitzpatrick et al. 2013))

    * Additional weights (if sampling in high currents or at depths of >40 m)

    * Sensors (e.g. temperature, current profilers)

    * Spare parts kits (O-rings and silicone grease etc)

    * Spare cameras (note need to recalibrate if cameras are replaced, which can be done post survey)

    * Spare bait bags/bait arms

* Deployment / retrieval rig:

    * Rope (1.5:1 rope length to depth ratio)

    * Marker buoys

    * Winch (or pot hauler)

    * Protective gloves and helmet

    * Towel/Cloths

* Other

    * GPS

    * Site maps with coordinates of sites

    * Hard drives

    * Laptop(s) with charger(s)

    * Powerboards and extension leads

    * Data sheets

    * Permits

    * Spare batteries and memory cards

    * Grapnel, extra weight and rope for BRUV recovery
