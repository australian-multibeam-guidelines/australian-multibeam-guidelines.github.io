Confirm sampling design is statistically sound and feasible with existing resources. Sampling design is crucial to ensuring that there is adequate replication and spatial independence to ensure a statistically sound study. Therefore, it is important that a statistician is consulted prior to beginning any sampling. Chapter 2 of this field manual package provides details of sampling design considerations, as well as example code and data for implementing a spatially-balanced design, as outlined in Foster et al. (2017). Specific sampling considerations pertaining to stereo-BRUVs include:

* Concurrent stereo-BRUVs should be separated by a minimum of 200-500 m to avoid bait plume overlap and animals moving between cameras.

* Deployments should be conducted at least 1 hour after sunrise and 1 hour before sunset to both improve visibility and remove the effect of crepuscular behaviour.

* Optimal soak time for comparisons with other studies is 60 mins. However, 30 min deployments may increase level of replication without sacrificing statistical power for reef-affiliated species accumulation curves (Harasti et al. 2015).

The time of fish biologists or taxonomists should be included as line items in budgets to ensure that all footage can meet appropriate QA/QC checks and species can be correctly identified. Care must be taken to ensure that a consistent nomenclature is used, with[ FishBase](http://www.fishbase.org/search.php), the[ World Register of Marine Species](http://www.marinespecies.org/) (WoRMS) and the[ Codes for Australian Aquatic Biota](https://www.cmar.csiro.au/caab/) (CAAB) being popular, authoritative sources of taxonomic information. Undescribed or unnamed species (e.g. defined operational taxonomic units) must also be meticulously documented to maximise consistent nomenclature among surveys and research groups. Archives of reference images from previous sampling campaigns have been established by numerous agencies across Australia and can serve as a useful benchmark for problematic sightings, which are kept up to date with recent taxonomic changes.

Consideration must be given to the location of stereo-BRUVs during deployment. Instruments should not be deployed inside shipping lanes, near fishing gear, or wherever they are likely to constitute or become a navigational hazard. At a minimum, deployment and retrieval locations should be recorded, with vessel location monitored at regular time intervals as a back-up. It should also be noted that deploying stereo-BRUVs on high relief reef or reef with tall algae can be very difficult or impossible. Potential entanglements with wildlife such as humpback whales also need consideration in some locations during certain times of the year, with interactions and encounters increasing as whale populations recover. Although this doesn’t preclude the use of stereo-BRUVs, it can limit how they are deployed and attended.

Ensure all permits, safety plans and approvals have been obtained. Any research undertaken within Australian Marine Parks (AMPs) requires a research permit issued from Parks Australia. Other potential permits and approvals that may be required include; animal ethics, safety plans. Risk assessments and state specific research permits. See Appendix B for a list of potential permits required at the Commonwealth level.

Obtain sufficient data storage and backups, including hard drives to copy and backup memory card from each camera (*2TB hard drives or greater recommended*). Ensure each hard drive is formatted and labelled appropriately. NOTE: You will need to allow for two copies of every deployment, one working and one backup. A single 60-minute video is currently around 8 GB if you are using 30 frames per second (FPS). Ensure sufficient memory cards for cameras are packed (*one 64 GB per camera plus spares is suggested*). Use high speed for greater downloading speeds. Number the memory cards to allow easy identification in the field. Ensure the downloading laptop is operational; laptops with multiple USB 3 ports are recommended for greater download speed and the ability to download footage from multiple memory cards at the same time. Planning to backup each hard drive in the field is essential. This can be done using either single hard drives, a faster solid state hard drive, a RAID hard drive system, cloudbase, or server-based data storage if cellular coverage is available. This will avoid data loss due to hardware failure that can occur.

Test appropriate lights and additional sensors. If using lights or sensors (temperature, light/PAR, current, etc), check they are working and fully charged and have chargers, spare parts, and the required equipment for downloading data whilst in the field or upon return to the lab. The Hobo Pendant temperature and light data loggers (UA-002-08) have been used with reliable results. The Marotte HS drag-tilt current meters (James Cook University;[ www.marinegeophysics.com.au/products/](http://www.marinegeophysics.com.au/products/)) can be fixed to the rear of the BRUV to move freely in the water column and record water temperature, current speed, and current direction.

Select and check appropriate camera settings are the same across all cameras (e.g. frame rate, video resolution, field of view mode, zoom, anti-shock sensors etc). Prior to any fieldwork, cameras should be checked to ensure they are serviced, cleaned, and calibrated (see below; note if a camera is moved or removed from its base plate it will need calibrating). It is important to note that small action cams (such as GoPro) do not perform particularly well in low-light conditions, especially with illuminated blue lights. If using such cameras, it is recommended that trials are undertaken prior to the sampling campaign. Clean and inspect housings for damage, check and replace o-rings if needed and lubricate with silicone grease. Ensure that housings are shipped with covers or protected in some way. This will prevent damage to the housing sealing surfaces and face plates.

Order sufficient quantities of bait well ahead of time. Due to differences in local supply, it is difficult to recommend a standardised baitfish. As a general rule a locally sourced, sardine-type, soft-fleshed, oily bait is recommended. This also reduces the likelihood of potential translocation of disease. Many BRUV studies from Australia have used pilchards (*Sardinops *spp.) as they are readily available, long lasting, and provide consistent bait size between field trips and studies (Dorman et al. 2012). Sourcing bait locally from factory discards (e.g. fish heads, tails and guts) is an attractive alternative for reducing costs and the ecological footprint of sampling. Allow at least 1 kg per planned BRUV deployment (recommended). When ordering, allow 20 % extra for repeating failed deployments.

Decide on the preparation and presentation of bait and consumables. Most studies use crushed or chopped bait presented in either a mesh bag or perforated PVC tubes. Bait arms should be angled towards the seabed and ideally in contact with the seabed so that the bait bag is not flapping in the current and so potentially disrupting fishes' natural inclination to be attracted to the bait (Cappo. pers. comm.). Ensure there are plenty of spare bait arms and bait bags or tubes. Bait arms may need to be reinforced with fibreglass rods if available or doubling up of PVC tubes. Having a number of rolls of duct tape and bags of cables ties is strongly recommended for running repairs.

 

Check ropes, bridles, floats/buoys for damage and ensure ropes are of sufficient length for the water depth that you are operating in (1.5:1 rope length to depth ratio). Float and rope configuration can also impact on deployment success. It is recommended that local trap fishers (e.g. lobster fishers) should be consulted on appropriate rope and float arrangement (Figure 5.5). Highly quality pot rope is recommended (e.g. New Zealand or Australian made). Check that there are a sufficient number and size of marker buoys and that they are coloured to make them visible at sea. Buoys should be marked with ‘Research’ and have each permit number. Make up spare ropes and floats in case gear is damaged or lost or damaged. Ensure sufficient weights are available for use at greater depths and in high currents. Typically double the weight is required at the front of the stereo-BRUV systems when deploying in deep water, but this arrangement will depend on local conditions and the frame design.

Check spare parts kit, make sure tools are oiled and in working order. Spare parts are crucial for repairs and troubleshooting BRUVs in the field.

Sampling gear specifications should always be fully documented to achieve maximum transparency and comparability. This includes documenting the camera model, camera height above seafloor, camera separation, camera angle, camera field of view, underwater light lumens and colour, bait arm length and bait holder type.

### **Calibrating stereo-BRUVS**

Stereo-BRUVS require regular calibration to ensure accurate measurements. The calibration process takes into account the base separation, camera angle and lens distortion all of which are unique to each camera, hosing and mount. Hence, each BRUV must be calibrated separately. Stereo-BRUVs should be calibrated using a 3D cube following recommendation by[ (Boutros et al. 2015)](https://paperpile.com/c/cxZoCG/Pzb9)

It is ideal to calibrate each BRUV before and after each field campaign. This provides a backup in the event a camera moves or gets damaged during fieldwork. If cameras are swapped in the field due to damage or some other issue, the new cameras will require post-field calibration.

SeaGIS ([https://www.seagis.com.au](https://www.seagis.com.au/)) have long been the primary provider of third-party calibration hardware and software, although alternative open-source packages have also begun to emerge, including the MATLAB Calibration Toolbox ([http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/)) or the StereoMorph R package ([https://cran.r-project.org/package=StereoMorph](https://cran.r-project.org/package=StereoMorph))[.](https://paperpile.com/c/cxZoCG/un9p+pAWx) For accurate and reliable stereo-calibration, SeaGIS software and calibration hardware is recommended.
