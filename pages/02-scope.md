This manual refers to the use of multibeam or interferometric echosounders (referred herein as just MBES) to conduct surveys of seafloor bathymetry and backscatter that can be used to derive maps of geomorphic features and benthic habitats. It does not mandate use of a specific interferometric3 or beamforming4 multibeam. The examples given herein refer to Kongsberg systems merely as an exemplar of the procedure to be conducted. Similarities can be drawn from these examples to any particular MBES system being employed on the survey.

 

There are several MBES that have been commonly used for surveying in Australian waters that would be suited to marine monitoring activities. It is important that the seafloor mapper be mindful that there are differences in the way bathymetric measurements are made from both interferometric and beamforming multibeam echosounders, and these influence the scale and resolution of features being detected and the fidelity of the acoustic measurements (which is important for monitoring). The main difference is namely due to beam formers measuring range for each of a set of angles, and interferometers measuring angle for each of a set of ranges (Table 5). We have outlined the standard methods that are relevant to any of these systems to provide a framework to create a nationally consistent MBES data archive for Australian marine and coastal waters.

 

This field manual details the specific four main phases of a seabed mapping survey (acquisition, processing, interpretation, reporting) that are required to meet the needs of monitoring programs (Figure 3.2). Although MBES can be used for water column data collection, these data are outside the scope of this standard operating procedural document in its current version (Version 0.1). This document provides guidance to organisations responsible for permitting and supporting research programs (e.g. Parks Australia) to collect multibeam data for monitoring programs (e.g. government research agencies, universities) to ensure consistency in acquisition and processing of multibeam acoustic data. This will increase the chance that data and spatial data products from different organisations and swath systems can be combined and reused into the future and become a valuable data asset for national research objectives; ongoing monitoring and planning.
