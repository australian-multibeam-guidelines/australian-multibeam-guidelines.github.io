This section is particularly relevant to the acquisition of MBES data within the Australian Marine Parks (AMPs), but can be used for any surveys where habitat monitoring is a key focus. The principles presented in the preceding sections of the Australian Multibeam Guidelines should still inform and influence the planning through to acquisition phases of MBES work undertaken in AMPs and the requirements detailed in this section should be seen as a complementary lens used to refine effort for the particular needs of benthic habitat monitoring.

The AMPs were established to protect and conserve areas of ecological significance within the Australian marine estate and cover 36 per cent of our oceans, or around 3.3 million square kilometres. To ensure adequate and appropriate management of these areas, the National Environmental Science Program Marine Biodiversity Hub, AusSeabed Community and Parks Australia have defined the requirements of MBES acquisition carried out within Australian Marine Parks. These requirements will maximise the environmental and societal benefits of any MBES data collection done in these areas.

There are two particular needs for mapping habitats in AMPs: 1) baseline surveys or monitoring surveys, which are firstâ€”time acquisition of high-resolution data for exploratory purposes; and 2) monitoring surveys, which consist of repeat mapping for monitoring benthic habitat change. MBES can be used for both survey types, however, they have different acquisition and post-processing specifications.

Baseline surveys are used to map the distribution of marine benthic habitats at a particular spatial scale and provide information necessary for more targeted field surveys using such tools as towed video, AUVs and stereo baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVs) (Lucieer et al. 2013, Monk et al. 2016, Wines et al. 2020). In contrast, monitoring surveys are used to assess change in distribution and extent of targeted habitats or features (such as rocky outcrops) identified during previous baseline surveys (Rattray et al. 2009, McGonigle et al. 2010). This type of survey requires MBES data to be collected at a higher resolution and with a greater degree of positional accuracy. The survey specifications and requirements needed to meet the aims of each survey type are presented in [Table 12](#bookmark=id.338fx5o).
