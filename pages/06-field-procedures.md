### **Arrival on site**

1. Unpack and set up stereo-BRUV units. Check for any breakages that may have occurred during transportations.

2. Attach bait bags to bait arms ensuring there are sufficient spares.

3. Check synchronizing device (such as diode batteries).

4. Defrost bait for first day of sampling.

5. All cameras and equipment should be carefully checked to ensure setting or switches havenâ€™t moved during transportation.

6. Check camera batteries are charged, memory cards are formatted and that everything is labelled.

7.  Discuss deployment plan and safety with the team and ensure the skipper has the coordinates for all sites.

### **Deployment**

1. Fill bait bags with ~1 kg of crushed or chopped bait.

2. Check camera settings.

3. Check data sheet is ready (note site, camera numbers and memory card numbers).

4. Move the BRUV frame to a secure and safe position.

5. Attach lights and sensors if required.

6. Turn cameras on, check there is battery and storage space available.

7. Film data sheet or information board so that the site/location is identifiable at the beginning of the video.

8. Insert cameras into housings, check that the housing is dry and that there is no sand, hair or other objects obstructing the o-rings, and ensure there is a good seal and the clips are tight. Use shark clips to lock if necessary.

9. Attach ropes and buoys. Ensure the rope is free, coiled, and facing the correct direction to uncoil without hindrance. Ensure there is a 1:1.5 depth to rope (10 m of water  = 15 m of rope). If there is a strong current you may need longer rope. It is also highly advised that there are several small surface floats followed by a large surface float.

10. Attach diode, or use clapper board, or alternative device to synchronise videos.

11. Attach bait arm.

12. With two people, lift the BRUV into position onto the gunnel or at the door of the vessel.

13. Push or throw the frame so that is clears the side of the boat. 

**Important**: If possible the skipper should keep the vessel directly above the site until the stereo-BRUV reaches the bottom and the crew gives the all clear to depart, i.e. all ropes clear of the boat. If the boat moves off the site before the cameras reach the bottom they will likely be pulled/tip over. 

To ensure it the BRUV lands upright in shallow water deployments (i.e. <40 m), tug the unit when it first hits the water to correct the horizontal orientation, then let it sink quickly until it reaches ~1-2 m from the seafloor (ask the skipper for the depth then count out rope lengths as you lower the BRUV to do this), then give it a good yank to make sure it is upright again and lower slowly for the remaining 1-2 m. You should also be able to feel if the BRUV lands well through the rope i.e. one jolt suggest a good landing compared to multiple when it hits bottom then keeps tumbling. A drop camera attached to the stereo-BRUV frame with a quick release system can also be used to ensure the stereo-BRUV lands upright and has a clear field of view. If the stereo-BRUV has fallen over or obstructed then you can simply lift it 1-2m and try lowering again. For deeper deployments, and in high current environments, weights should be added to ensure the frames do not drag or flip. It is recommended that when operating in depth >40 m, and using SeaGis BRUV frames, that two weights are added to the front first then one to the back if necessary. Also, if operating at depth and in high currents that you may need to feed the buoys and rope out in a broad circle around the sample site prior to dropping the BRUV in the water. This reduces the OHS risk associated with long ropes.

14. On the data sheet, note the exact time of deployment and depth off the depth sounder, include comments where necessary e.g. issues, weather conditions.

15. Mark a GPS waypoint and log the GPS coordinates of the deployment on the recording sheet.

16. Once all stereo-BRUVs are deployed it is important to move away from where stereo-BRUVs are set to avoid impacts of vessel noise on fish assemblages.

### **Retrieval**

1. It is currently recommended that stereo-BRUV deployments are made for a minimum of 60 minutes to allow for comparisons with other studies. Therefore, the first stereo-BRUV can be retrieved after a minimum of 60 minutes from deployment.

2. The skipper should manoeuvre the vessel alongside the floats heading upwind or current towards the stereo-BRUV. A crew member will either gaff or grapple the rope near the floats and quickly hand haul in the slack rope.

3. The skipper should then manoeuvre the vessel directly above the stereo-BRUV. Once above the stereo-BRUV,the rope should be placed in the pot hauler or winch if available or pulled by hand.

4. It is important that the stereo-BRUV is not hauled until the vessel is directly above. This is to minimise the risk of snagging the rope or stereo-BRUV and to minimise damage to the habitat.

5. As the stereo-BRUV comes off the bottom the skipper should then manoeuvre the boat downwind or current to assist retrieval.

6. Only a crew member who is trained in using the pot hauler or winch, or under supervision by a trained crew member, should winch the stereo-BRUV.

7. The second crew member should help coil the rope that will aid in a quick redeployment.

8. Once the stereo-BRUV comes into view and is close to the boat, inform the skipper and slow the winch to ensure the bait and diode and facing away from the vessel.

9. The stereo-BRUV should be winched onto the deck or gunnel and carefully lowered down.

10. Dry the seals around the housing with a towel and carefully remove the cameras (if conducting surveys over multiple days, the O-rings will require cleaning and re-greasing with silicone at regular intervals, ideally daily).

11. Stop cameras recording, and turn them off. Store cameras in a dry, safe place until next deployment. If possible, turn off lights to conserve battery.

12. Remove memory cards and store.

13. If required charge or change camera batteries.

14. Either setup the stereo-BRUV for redeployment or secure on deck.

### **Retrieval of snagged or lost BRUV**

In the event that a BRUV becomes snagged on the bottom the following procedure should be followed:

1. Stop retrieval.

2. Reposition vessel in opposite direction to initial attempt and recommence retrieval.

3. Repeat as necessary altering retrieval direction each time. Caution is needed as it is important to not allow rope to become worn either because of fouling on reef or at the pot hauler.

4. Some types of stereo-BRUV frames either bend or break at sacrificial pins (if fitted).

In the event that a stereo-BRUV is lost (rope cut or the current drags the camera system) the following procedure should be followed:

1. Attempt to grapple camera frame or rope. This can be challenging in deep water and will take time. A good technique for grappling in deep water is to attach weights every ~10 m on grapple line. Deploy the grapple line so that you encircle the stereo BRUV location. Weighting the grapple line ensures a higher chance of entangling lost stereo BRUV or its rope. Retrieve grapple and repeat as necessary.

2. If this fails an alternative approach is to locate lost stereo-BRUV using drop camera system or ROV if available. A depth sounder could also be used to rope and locate floats if submerged.

3. Lower the drop camera on the grapple rope to locate stereo-BRUV.

4. Winch as usual.

5. If the stereo BRUV system is not retrieved within 60 minutes, mark its exact location with GPS and/or anchored rope with buoys. Mobilize dive team (if in shallow enough water) or a ROV (for deeper waters) if available.

6. Notify Parks Australia of lost equipment if operating in an AMP.

### **Fieldwork data management**

Data management and quality control is crucial for monitoring and comparisons between studies within AMPs. Following simple steps and using easily understandable and transferable metadata (Table 10) will enable simple harmonisation between studies.

1. Store used cards separately from unused cards to avoid confusion. If storing all memory cards to download, ensure they are clearly labelled and stored in a waterproof container. Memory cards should not be re-used or reformatted until data has been downloaded and a backup created.

2. If downloading occurs in the field it is important that all hard drives are clearly labelled in a way that can be discerned from the file name. For example: using the date, study name, and hard drive number, "176022_Groote_Island_stereo-BRUV_HD1".

3. Files should also be labelled in a way that can be discerned from the filename. For example, with site_year_month_day_study_cam1_cam2_L (folders on hard drives should follow a naming convention so that programs like "Bulk Rename Utility" can be easily used to rename all files with OpCode and camera number in the correct format).

4. Field metadata sheets should be transcribed/backed-up into a database or Excel spreadsheet which should be saved and backed up daily.
