# Appendix B – Glossary

Below are some of the terms used in these guidelines. A more extensive list of hydrographic terms and definitions can be found in Table 2.1.2 of AHO (2018).

**% Overlap:** refer to the amount of overlap between adjacent swaths. 0% overlap means that the ship tracks are run so that the outer beams of the swath meet the outer beam of the adjacent swath, which is not recommended, 10-20 % overlap is recommended (Figure B1). 100% overlap means that the adjacent ship track is run along the outer beam edge (meeting the required specification) of the previous swath (Figure B2). Refer to section 7.4 of AHO (2018) for more details

_**Figure B1** 100% swath coverage with 10-20 % overlap to account for ship role and line keeping (AHO, 2018)_

<img src="images/figures/imageB2.png" width="100%">

_**Figure B2** 200% swath coverage with 100 % overlap (AHO, 2018)_

**Blunders:** See Error, gross.

**Checkline:** Sounding lines that are run perpendicular to the main survey lines and used to QA the soundings. 

**Coverage:** portion of the seabed cover by the multibeam swath. 100% coverage refers to 100% of the seabed covered by the swath without any overlap (Figure B1), while 200% coverage refers to 100 % overlap (Figure B2). Partial coverage refers to a seabed coverage that is less than 100%.

**Crossline:** also known as checkline

**Depth:** Depth is a vertical distance from a given vertical datum. Depths are derived by MBES from measurements of angles and ranges corrected for environmental factors. Horizontal Position is provided to derived depth by GNSS-Inertial system thus providing an xyz value. GNSS Inertial system derived vertical position from measurements of angular rates and acceleration.

**Dimension control:** consists of determining the relationship between the measurement sensor and the platform Common Reference Point. 

**Error:** The difference between an observed or computed value of a quantity and the ideal or true value of that quantity.

**Error, gross:** The result of carelessness or a mistake; may be detected through repetition of the measurement. Also called _blunder._

**Error, random:** remaining uncorrelated noise in the system, or noise, also known as accidental error.

**Patch test:** A patch test is a specific survey performed prior to principal survey to allow adjustments of the MBES data for parameters such as transducer error (pitch, roll and yaw), and navigation latency. This test is done since the MBES has no reference to external fixed frame of reference (satellite constellation isn’t visible underwater), the MBES receives its “frame” from GNSS-Inertial system. These adjustments are entered in the acquisition software. For patch test patterns see [Appendix F](https://australian-multibeam-guidelines.github.io/appendices#appendix-f--patch-test).

**Seabed backscatter:** Defined as the amount of acoustic energy being received by the sonar after a complex interaction with the seabed.  Measured as the ratio between the intensity of the acoustic pulse scattered back by the seafloor and the incident intensity, this information can be used to determine bottom type, knowing that the different bottom types “scatter” sound energy differently. The intensity of the backscatter received at the transducer depends on the transmitted source level, the transmission loss (absorption in the water column and geometrical spreading), and the target strength. Many multibeam sonar systems offer two types of seabed backscatter data namely “one-per-beam” backscatter (either beam average or max intensity) and “time series” backscatter. For further information on backscatter refer to Lamarche and Lurton, 2017

**Sounding datum:** This datum is used while mapping. It is a low-water plane to which soundings are reduced and above which drying heights are given on the Standard Sheet and in other survey records. However, for chart datum, tidal reduction is essential ([Figure 3](https://australian-multibeam-guidelines.github.io/pre-survey-planning#252-tidal-or-ellipsoidal-datum)). 

**Swath system:** Current swath sounding systems utilize two differing technologies to achieve bathymetry measurements across a “swath” of the sea floor: 1) Beam forming (multibeam echo sounders), and 2) interferometric or phase discrimination sonars, also known as bathymetric sidescan. Both of these techniques have their merits; however, the same end results are achieved.

**Systematic error:** see error.

**Transit data:** Transit data include any data collected outside the survey specific area, e.g. data collected between port and survey area or between sampling sites. In hydrographic terms, this is referred to as passage soundings. 

**Water Column backscatter:** Recently developed multibeam sonars have the capability to record the sonar time series for each beam, which maps the water column in addition to the seafloor. Water column data could be used for direct mapping of fish and marine mammals, the mapping of plumes and vents, the location of mid-water targets, and a wide range of physical oceanographic processes.

Laws and regulations regarding multibeam sonar acquisition in State and Territory waters (less than 3 nm from the coast) vary slightly across jurisdictions, but they are generally not restricted or subject to permit requirements, with the exception of:
*   Survey undertaken in Marine Protected Areas (for guidance see Marine Protected Areas section above). 
*   Survey carrying out extractive work (marine biota) or work that could be considered destructive to marine habitats. 
*   Surveys undertaken across areas with access restrictions (e.g., naval waters, commercial ports, or shipping channels). 
*   Surveys carried out In New South Wales for the purposes of resource exploration (permission through NSW Resources and Energy - Environment and Planning).

# Appendix H – Records templates

The following appendix provides suggested templates for Records that should be produced during a seabed mapping survey. These templates can also be downloaded on the [AusSeabed](http://www.ausseabed.gov.au/resources/guidelines) website (with the exception of the AusSeabed required metadata table.

# _H.1 Mobilisation, calibration and validation report_

The following [link](http://www.ausseabed.gov.au/tools/ausseabed-record-templates) provides you with the template.

# _H.2 AusSeabed minimum required metadata_

Below is a table with specific field definitions and examples for each metadata field expected to accompany data submitted to AusSeabed in order for AusSeabed to assume custodianship of, and to exclusively publish the data. The fields specified are considered a minimum set that can be extended to include fields outlined in [section 2.3.1.3](https://australian-multibeam-guidelines.github.io/pre-survey-planning#231-data-type-formats-and-metadata), but should not be deviated from, replaced, or altered. Note that on submission it is only required to provide the Field column and the associated survey metadata, the other columns in the table are provided for illustrative purposes only.
