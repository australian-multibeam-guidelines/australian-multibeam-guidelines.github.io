# Platform description

Swath mapping systems use acoustic technology to collect information on the bathymetry (topography) and the backscatter (impedance) of the seafloor (Figure 3.1). These systems can either be mounted on a ship, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), remotely operated vehicle (ROV) or an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). They work by transmitting a sound pulse, called a ping, through a transmitter at a specific frequency (or are able to sweep through a range of frequencies). This same ping is then recorded through a receiver placed very close to the transmitter. The elapsed time that the ping takes to reach the seafloor and return to the receiver is used to measure the depth of the water. Certain attributes of the shape of the sound-wave are used to infer characteristics about the seafloor (geomorphology, substrate type) (Figure 3.1 a-d). 

 

Swath mapping systems, including multibeam and interferometric echosounders, have become one of the standard tools for geophysical surveying and mapping of the seafloor and have been used for a variety of scientific, safety at sea (hydrographic and military operations) and industrial applications. These systems can produce a spatially continuous acoustic image of the surface of the seafloor by generating a "swath" or “fan” of closed spaced data points, increasing the resolution of the resulting surfaces. This has revolutionized our ability to understand physical processes occurring at the seafloor, and the composition and distribution of substrate, which has in turn significantly improved our knowledge of seafloor ecosystems (McArthur et al. 2010, Lucieer and Lamarche 2011, Porter-Smith et al. 2012). Mapping of bathymetric morphology will delineate geological features that have relief (using the changes in seafloor depth information), however in regions where the relief is smaller than the minimum mapping unit (resolution of the grid cell is larger than the feature of interest) backscatter data can be used to assess the boundaries of the geology or sediment structure.

 

Australia’s marine jurisdiction spans an incredible range of water depths; from the coast to over 6000 m. Water depth has a very large influence on the acoustic survey acquisition as it will dictate the resolution of the data (i.e., number of pings per unit area which will dictate the minimum pixel size) and the efficiency for surveying using swath mapping systems (i.e., swath width). While practices for employing the equipment have developed rapidly over the last few decades, there are a number of specific and common issues that need to be considered and detailed in a national standard operating field manual. This document has been developed in collaboration with the *Australian Multibeam Guidelines* written by the AusSeabed working group which includes over 40 representatives from government departments, scientific institutions, universities and industry (see inset box).

 

During the development of Version 1 of this manual, a broader assessment of multibeam survey standards by a national seabed mapping coordination working group was started. The resulting AusSeabed program ([www.ausseabed.gov.au](http://www.ausseabed.gov.au/) ) developed the *Australian Multibeam Guidelines* (Picard et al. 2018). These guidelines are relevant for a wider range of purposes such as hydrographic mapping and marine infrastructure installation and planning. The *Australian Multibeam Guidelines* provides a more detailed description of the technical considerations of acquisition and international surveying standards, including details of operational procedures.

 

In order to avoid duplication of details, this field manual will provide a procedure for specific planning, acquisition and processing steps relevant to marine monitoring. Where applicable, it will refer to the *Australian Multibeam Guidelines* (Picard et al. 2018) for further details of operational steps. It will also provide further specific details of pre- and post-surveying considerations required for marine monitoring activities when planning swath mapping surveys.  This will include surveys required for both broad scale mapping to inform the development of habitat maps, and those being conducted as a component of monitoring.  Further details of marine sampling platforms used to ground truth acoustic data, and to monitor of ecological indicators are presented in the accompanying NESP field manuals (Chapters 4-9).
