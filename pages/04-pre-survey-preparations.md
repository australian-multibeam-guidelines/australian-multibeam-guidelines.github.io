There are several important factors that first need to be considered in order to ensure relevant areas are surveyed, time and costs can be accurately estimated, appropriate vessels and acquisition gear is used, and previous survey data are considered.

 

Firstly, it is important that all spatial data for the survey region must be sourced to gain a preliminary understanding of the seabed as this will influence several survey considerations. This information can be used to create a *survey plan*, which would include a summary of the following components:

 

·         The coverage of the area to be surveyed (bounding box) with the datum and coordinate system clearly identified,

·         Planned survey lines (direction and acquisition order of the survey lines),

·         System calibration survey lines (patch test),

·         Seafloor topography (features of interest) and slope, and

·         The location and frequency of the Sound Velocity Profile (SVP).

 

Background spatial data might include electronic nautical charts from the Australian Hydrographic Office (AHO), aerial photos (in shallow water regions), satellite imagery, LiDAR or satellite derived bathymetry data.  It may also include previous maps of seabed habitats generated from single beam acoustic surveys or maps of sediment distribution from broad scale seafloor grab or dredge surveys.  Information on seabed habitats can also be collected by analysing the distribution of other activities conducted within the survey region (for example, ancillary research such as fisheries surveys may be an indicator of habitat type). Refer to[ AusSeabed](http://marine.ga.gov.au/#/mbes_coverage) coverage map and data hub to identify existing MBES surveys noting that the website and repository are under development.

 

The survey plan aims to establish the range of water depths and seafloor complexity across the survey region. The range of water depths will define how many survey lines need to be conducted to ensure sufficient overlap between the acoustic swaths to guarantee 100 % seafloor coverage (refer to Chapter 2 where coverage may relate to selected sampling sites). Where the water depth is relatively constant (such as on the outer continental shelf), the survey plan may provide adequate structure for accurate planning. In shallower waters, where the depths may change rapidly (or are unknown to the resolution of national satellite derived products) a comprehensive plan of survey lines may not be useful, as they will need to be modified as the bathymetric data are collected. In this case, a defined survey area boundary (polygon) with an initial survey line for calibration may be sufficient.

 

An essential component of the survey-planning phase is the need to obtain the relevant permits that may apply for sediment data collection which is common for MBES data validation, especially when conducted within marine parks. See Appendix B for a list of potential permits needed.

 

Following the establishment of the survey plan the logistical preparations for data acquisition can be conducted. These are outlined in the following sections and recorded in the vessel or field logbook over the duration of the survey and made available in the final reporting documentation.

 

Refer to Section 2 of the Australian National Guidelines to access further planning details (Picard et al., 2018). This include submitting basic metadata information to an[ upcoming survey register](http://marine.ga.gov.au/#/upcoming_surveys) to inform the seabed mapping community of the mapping intentions and promote further collaboration and optimise the survey.
