## Role
<img src='/images/brooke-gibbons.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
My main roles in the UWA Marine Ecology Fisheries research lab include statistical analysis, planning and conducting fieldwork, database collation and helping postgraduate students with their studies.

## About me
I grew up in Perth and completed my Bachelor of Science in Physical and Analytical Chemistry with a second major in Marine Science, at UWA in 2016. After finishing my undergraduate degree, I decided that a chemistry lab wasn't for me. I began my Masters degree in Marine Biology in the second half of 2016, under the supervision of [Dr. Tim Langlois](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/researchers/tim-langlois/), [Dr. Jane Prince](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/jane-prince), [Dr. Jordan Goetze](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/Jordan.Goetze), [Dr. Joachim Claudet](http://www.joachimclaudet.com/publications.html), and [Dr. Lauric Thiault](http://www.criobe.pf/pro/personnel/chercheurs-contractuels-et-post-doctorants/lauric-thiault/). My research found that marine reserves in Mo'orea, French Polynesia, decrease fish wariness but do not increase abundance. I now work in the UWA Marine Ecology Group Fisheries research lab as a research assistant for Dr. Tim Langlois.
