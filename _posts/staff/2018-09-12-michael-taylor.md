## Role 
<img src='/images/square-michael-taylor-profile.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
My main role in the Marine Ecology Group - Fisheries Lab is assisting with the research conducted by [Dr. Dianne McLean](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/researchers/dianne-mclean/ "Dianne McLean"), running and maintaining laboratoy equipment, and helping post-graduate students with their studies. Our main research focus, at this stage, is on fish ecology and associations with offshore infrastructure in Western Australia. As a research assistant my responsibilities include field data collection, video and statistical analysis, as well as assisting in the writing and publication of research. 

## About me
Originally from Hong Kong, I grew up in southern England before attending the University of Sheffield and graduating with honours in Zoology. I then moved to Perth in order to complete a Master of Biological Sciences, focused on marine biology, at UWA. This research on ontogenetic shifts in the emperor species *Lethrinus punctulatus* was conducted in the Marine Ecology Group - Fisheries Research Lab with [Dr. Dianne McLean](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/researchers/dianne-mclean/ "Dianne McLean"), [Dr. Tim Langlois](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/researchers/tim-langlois/ "Tim Langlois") and [Camilla Piggott](https://uwamegfisheries.github.io/students/camilla-piggott/ "Camilla Piggott") as my supervisors. On completing my Masters in 2016 I started working in the Marine Ecology Group - Fisheries Research Lab as a Research Assistant using stereo-video to better understand fish ecology and communities associated with artificial structures off the coast of Western Australia.
