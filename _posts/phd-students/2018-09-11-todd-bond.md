## The influence of subsea infrastructure on fish and fisheries and the implications for decommissioning 
<img src='/images/square-todd-bond-profile.png' align='right' width="350" hspace="20" vspace="10">
Decommissioning off shore infrastructure is a major global issue set to cost Australia $18 billion over the next 50 years. In Australia, full removal of infrastructure is required at this phase unless alternatives, such as leaving infrastructure in-situ, are shown to reduce impacts and risks to as low as reasonably practicable. My research assesses the value of in-situ infrastructure to fish ecology and fisheries on the North West Shelf of Western Australia, and will provide scientific evidence to enable decommissioning alternatives. 

## About me
I grew up in Perth and graduated from UWA in 2009 with an Honours degree in Marine Science. For the past 7 years I have worked with the Marine Ecology Group in the Fisheries Research Lab at UWA, using stereo-video to better understand fish ecology and communities throughout the world. Recently, I have been working with oil and gas operators on the North West Shelf to understand how fish may be interacting with their subsea infrastructure.
