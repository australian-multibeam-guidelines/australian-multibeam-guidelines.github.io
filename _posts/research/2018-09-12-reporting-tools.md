With [National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) funding and in collaboration with the Australian Ocean Data Network we are implementing State of the Environment reporting tools for national ecological datasets. The current [National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) funding will be used to develop macro-ecological reporting tools designed for communication with decision makers and stakeholders.
