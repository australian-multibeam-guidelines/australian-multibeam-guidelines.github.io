We have devised and implemented cloud infrastructure to collate and synthesise global marine ecological data [(GlobalArchive)](http://globalarchive.org/). This initiative has now been supported in Australia by [Integrated Marine Observing System](http://imos.org.au/home/) (IMOS), the [National Environmental Science Programme](http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp) (NESP) and [National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources](https://nectar.org.au/) (NECTAR), and this year we will be further developing work under the [National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) (NCRIS). Internationally we are collaborating with the [GlobalFinPrint project](https://globalfinprint.org/) and [Paul G. Allen Philanthropies](http://www.pgaphilanthropies.org/) to coordinate with comparable global initiatives.
